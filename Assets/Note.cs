/*griders have two states 
 * straight & final
straight is for kinematic which changes after kong ground smash
final is our real level design
each level platforms are in a group of platform and therir each pos is save in an array right before changing to stratight mod
then with fireing a function we convert the staright mod to final mod in cinematic 
so now we should make the final mod of each level

inshaallah

considerations 
script should be removed from first gridder
